Team 9 MangaFlow ReadMe:

1. Bookshelf (table view)
2. Disappearing Navigation bar and info (bottom) bar
3. Page view to panel view transition
4. The bread and butter of our app, the auto segmentation of the comic page to panels
5. Two tiers architectures (Top to manage mode and image sources to low tier, and low tier just need to display the 3 images and the animation)
